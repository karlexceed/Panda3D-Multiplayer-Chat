# Panda3D-Multiplayer-Chat
This is a simple Client Server Networking framework initially made for the Panda 3D game engine in 2009. It's a good place to learn about how to do game networking, but needs many improvements. Project works with current (1.10) version of Panda3D, pull-requests an documentation writers are welcome.

## Getting Started
To get Started you will need to run both the server and client.

Run the Server first using the batch file in \server directory or by typing following in cmd
```bash
    cd ./server
    ./run.bat
```
Now Run the Client using the batch file in \client directory or by typing following in cmd
```bash
    cd ./client
    ./run.bat
```
